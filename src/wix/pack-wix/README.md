# wix - the WiX Toolset from the command-line

The `wix` package provides the WiX Toolset as a .NET Tool, perfect for your command-line packaging pleasure (even if we recommend using the [WixToolset.Sdk][sdk]).

## Before we begin

For most users, we recommend using the [WixToolset.Sdk][sdk] to build your installation packages instead of this command-line tool. The Sdk provides a better development experience than the command-line, especially as your project grows. The following is a quick example.

Example project file: `QuickStart.wixproj`
```
<Project Sdk="WixToolset.Sdk/7.0.0">
</Project>
```

Example source code: `QuickStart.wxs`
```
<Wix xmlns="http://wixtoolset.org/schemas/v4/wxs">
  <Package Id="AcmeCorp.QuickStart" Name="QuickStart Example" Manufacturer="ACME Corp" Version="0.0.1">
    <File Source="example.txt" />
  </Package>
</Wix>
```

Build your MSI from the command-line:
```
dotnet build
```


## Getting started

If you still decide to use this command-line tool instead of the [WixToolset.Sdk][sdk], install the latest version with:

```
dotnet tool install --global wix
```

Verify it was successfully installed with:

```
wix --version
```
